sidux-art-wallpaper-nyx (0.2) unstable; urgency=low

  The cdbs is retarded release.

  [ Bernard Gray ]
  * update sidebar in source svg.

  [ Stefan Lippers-Hollmann ]
  * always regenerate PNGs in the build/$(DEB_SOURCE_PACKAGE) target; this
    package only provides some graphics based svg sources, so this is the only
    sane choice. 
    Unfortunately cdbs links up build/$(DEB_SOURCE_PACKAGE) to "build" and 
    "binary" targets, which means the image gets generated twice while
    building...
